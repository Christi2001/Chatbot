Hello.

You will find attached the project files, the unit tests and the CMakeLists 
file, a .jpg file named "githistory.jgp" containing a screenshot of my git 
repository for this coursework and a .mp4 file named "video_presentation.mp4" 
containing a video presentation of the functionality of my program. 
The final project is a bit different from the design plan I submitted, but 
in some regards, the design has been improved (for example, in the planned 
design, appointments could be made for up to a month, now they don't have 
any restrains).

You can talk to the chatbot using natural language and it will understand 
requests such as: making or cancelling an appointment, showing a list of 
departments or doctors at the clinic and showing the price of a consultation 
once it knows which doctor you are referring to. When you want to end the 
conversation, just say "goodbye", "bye" or "quit", or respond with "no" 
when it asks if you want help with anything else. It also saves the 
conversations in a file named "chatlog.txt" for future revisions. It is 
not the smartest chatbot, as it doesn't use AI, but it does its tasks 
resonably well.

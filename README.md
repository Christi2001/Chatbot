# Chatbot for Medical Practice
### by Christian Constantin Pustianu

Hello!
You can talk to the chatbot using natural language and it will understand 
requests such as: making or cancelling an appointment, showing a list of 
departments or doctors at the clinic and showing the price of a consultation 
once it knows which doctor you are referring to. When you want to end the 
conversation, just say "goodbye", "bye" or "quit", or respond with "no" 
when it asks if you want help with anything else. It also saves the 
conversations in a file named "chatlog.txt" for future revisions. It is 
not the smartest chatbot, as it doesn't use AI, but it does its tasks 
resonably well.

Have fun!
